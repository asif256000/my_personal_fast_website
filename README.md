# My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This website serves as a showcase of my skills and projects. This website is currently hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) at [asifiqbal.xyz](https://asifiqbal.xyz/).

## Tech Stack

This website is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Future Plans

I plan to move the tech stack to Rust and VueJS to learn those technologies as well.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

- Project 1: Developed automated root cause analysis framework for detecting worst cells for network companies.
- Project 2: Developed automated cloud deployment framework for deploying a product for a company in AWS.
- Project 3: Developing and optimizing boolean cell cycle model by analyzing perturbations.
